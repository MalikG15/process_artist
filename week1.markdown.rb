Did you remember how to program?
  I remember some of the things that we learned during our bootcamp, but I know that I have to practice my coding to a large extent to make sure I am where I need to be.
What parts of this week were harder than you expected?
  I think what was really difficult was figuring out how to translate my english process into code, especially during the when we were doing ruby processing.
 What parts were easy?
  None of the parts were easy to me. They were all a challenge.
 Ruby Warrior:
 Q1: I think that we spent a lot of time on ruby warrior becuase it allowed us to think about we could use our code to decipher several different scenarios.
 Q2: I think it was really effective way to learn, becuase I was able to gain the knowledge that "or" is a very powerful concept within Ruby. It can help us to keep the amount of code we use down and simplify things to a great extent.
 Q3: The phrase the "algorithm was hard" ment that the way we had to think about each step and setting up our code would be extremely difficult.
Processing
 Q1: What was easy was going over the code that Jeff gave us and understanding what he did.
 Q2: We spent time in processing in order for us to gain the concept that some Ruby programs have ancestors that we can call certain methods from.
